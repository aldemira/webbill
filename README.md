This is an attempt to port original xbill-2.1 to Phaser3. I've decided to use original artwork as I'm not a graphics designer and lack those skills.

INSTALLATION: 
Put all the files in a web server,  and browse it!

DISCLAMER: I'm neither a JS developer nor a fan of javascript. So this code isn't a state of art programming. If you don't like anything about it, feel free to send a PR!

DISCLAMER++: Also what a better place to piece this software on a M$ own site as a joke. 

Original Programming by:
  Main Programmer:
      Brian Wellington <bwelling@xbill.org>
  Programming & graphics (v2.0 and earlier):
      Matias Duarte <matias@hyperimage.com>
