This is an attempt to port original xbill-2.1 to Phaser3. I've decided to use original artwork as I'm not a graphics designer and lack those skills.

**WARNING**: This is still incomplete and work-in-progress.

## DEMO
https://aldemira.github.io/webbill/

## INSTALLATION 
Put all the files in a web server,  and browse it!

**DISCLAMER** : I'm neither a JS developer nor a fan of javascript. So this code isn't a state of art programming. If you don't like anything about it, feel free to send a PR!

**DISCLAMER++**: Also what a better place to put this software, on a M$'s own site as a joke. 

## Credits
Original Programming by:
  Main Programmer:
      Brian Wellington <bwelling@xbill.org>
